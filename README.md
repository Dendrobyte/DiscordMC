#DiscordMC
This is a plugin that runs on a Minecraft server, and acts as a bridge between the server and Discord. To use this plugin, and it's features, you must therefore know how to set up a bot user for Discord.
##Library
The plugin uses [Discord4J](https://discord4j.com/) as the main Library to communicate with Discord, and we therefore encourage you to check their documentation, if you wish to modify this code.
